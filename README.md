# Advanced Machine Learning

This repository hosts the final project (***`Final Project folder`***) for Advanced Machine Learning exam, held by Professor Fabio Galasso, as part of the Master’s degree in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Exam Structure**
The Fundamentals of Data Science exam comprised one assignments (***`Practice`***,***`Report_Cesario_Ciciani_Oddi_Zeller.pdf`***,***`Theory`***), a final project(***`Report_Cesario_Ciciani_Oddi_Zeller.pdf`*** inside the Final Project folder), and a oral exam that covered theoretical concepts .<br>
This repository contains the details of the assignment and final project component of the course.

### **Project Overview**
Here’s a revised and more detailed overview of the project for the README:

**Scene Classification with Vision Transformers and Hybrid Models**

This project builds upon the work of [Dosovitskiy et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), exploring the application of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for scene classification tasks. Using a subset of the Places365 dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of ViTs, hybrid CNN-Transformer models, and advanced CNN architectures. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of combining local feature extraction (via CNNs) with global spatial reasoning (via Transformers) in a scene-centric classification context.

Key steps include:
- Adapting pre-trained Vision Transformer models to the scene classification task.
- Fine-tuning hybrid models, such as ResNet-50 + ViT-B/16, for enhanced performance.
- Benchmarking these models against CNN-based architectures like ResNet-50 and DenseNet.
- Analyzing model outputs using attention maps to understand how features are captured.
